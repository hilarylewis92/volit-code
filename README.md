# Volit - Simple Volunteer Management
The goal of Volit is to create a simple way for organizations and volunteers to coordinate scheduling.  Volunteer coordinators will be able to setup different roles that need filled at events and volunteers will be able to easily manage which roles they can fill.  The system will also provide a convenient reminder system with the ability to confirm or decline a volunteer opportunity and allow for easily swapping volunteer assignments in the event a role is not able to be filled.
